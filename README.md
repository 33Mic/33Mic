### Hey there!
I'm a student from Alberta, Canada who enjoys classical music, rhythm games, and stressing over why my code doesn't work (But it's absolutely beautiful when it does!). I'm currently studying at the University of Alberta and am totally open to any sort of opportunities to learn to improve my code!
